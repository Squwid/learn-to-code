EVERYTHING IS PASSED BY VALUE IN GO

Section 1
    Compiler puts in semi-colons automatically
    GoLang.org only std library
    GoDoc.org all libraries (including third party packages)

Section 2
    Go workspace
    One Folder (Any name, any location)
        bin
        pkg
        src
            github.com
                <username>
                    folder with code for project / repo
                    folder with code for project / repo
                    folder with code for project / repo
                    folder with code for project / repo

Section 02:
    Say exported/unexported instead of public/private

Section 03:
    Shorthand:
        can only be used inside func
    var:
        zero value
    Type Format Verb:

Section 06 (Constants):
    Constant is a parallel type which is not a normal type (ex. int string)
    Go is statically typed (cant change after run time)
    There are TYPED and UNTYPED constants
        const hello = "Hello World" // UNTYPED
        const typedHello string = "Hello World" // TYPED


    x := 42     // UNTYPED
    y := x + 19 //
