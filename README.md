# Learning Go

I have been using Go every chance I get, however I figured out that I really did not know what was going on behind the scenes, so I decided to purchase a course from Udemy by Todd McLeod. I decided to take notes while I watched each video and decided to put them on publically on my GitHub for my own reference.

## Why choose Go

* Performant - Right up there with C (Go is way easier to code in)

* Multiple Core Support (Concurrency)

* Made to run well in Network environments

## Learning Resources

* [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/)

* [50 Shades of Go](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/)

* [Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/)

* [Go Docs](https://golang.org/doc/)
